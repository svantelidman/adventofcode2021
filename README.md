Solutions for all problems of AoC 2021 in Rust.
* All original work (no peeking in the Reddit thread or any other help)
* Not always pretty
* Sometimes very slow, in particular (Macbook Pro 2018):

  * Day 19 ~ 12 minutes
  * Day 15 ~ 50 minutes (heck, you should not optimize what only should be run once, or rewrite your silly search to a better one if it works well enough)
